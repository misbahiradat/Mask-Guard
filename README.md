## Overview

In today's world, ensuring that individuals in public spaces wear face masks is increasingly important. Introducing an AI system that can detect mask compliance in real-time offers a significant benefit to society. This project constructs a basic Face Mask Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning approach. We leverage the power of TensorFlow and OpenCV to create a real-time CNN model, ready for various applications, including malls, theaters, and parks.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV-Python 📷
- Pandas 🐼
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib 📈
- TensorFlow-GPU 🤖
- Keras 🧠

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the python script in 'src' folder with your webcam connected.

## Usage

- The script continuously monitors the video feed from your webcam.
- It detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time.
- Mask compliance is visually indicated by bounding boxes and labels.
